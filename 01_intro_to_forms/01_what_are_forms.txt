Forms
What are Forms?

When working in most application, user information is gathered using forms.
Forms are mostly different input fields asking unique questions.
Data gathered from forms is usually used later in the backend of the application.

In Django, these forms look and act generally the same as normal HTML forms.
The largest difference between Django forms and HTML forms is that Django uses a model based system to handle the data.
More information can be found in MDN’s HTML forms documentation.

When creating forms in Django, we have a number of different options available in regards to building the form.
In this lesson, we’ll go over some of these methods.
Including one that allows Django to build the form for us, reducing the amount of HTML we have to write ourselves.
