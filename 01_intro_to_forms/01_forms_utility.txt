Why are Forms Useful?

Django also makes form creation and handling form information a breeze.

When surfing the internet, youâ€™re constantly interacting with forms and you might not even realize it!

Looking something up on a search engine? Signing up for a new account? Logging in? Ordering from your favorite restaurant?
These applications all use forms one way or another.
Typically these forms are all written in HTML, but with Django and DTL you can create forms even quicker and suited for your needs.
